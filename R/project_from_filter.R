#' Project from Filtering Distribution
#'
#' This function simulates from a Haiti-cholera POMP model into the future
#' starting from filtering distribution at the the last time point available.
#'
#' Because we are primarily interested in projecting the number of Cholera
#' cases in the future under various vaccination scenarios, it makes sense to
#' use as much information as possible, as simulating from the start of the
#' time series will ultimately disregard the known truth at the end of the
#' available date. The state of the system at the end of the time series
#' can be accounted for by simulating the filtering distribution:
#'
#' \deqn{Xk | Y1 = y1*, \ldots, Yk*}
#'
#' As currently implemented, the efficiency could be greatly improved for
#' projecting models that do not have covariates.
#'
#' @param mod: POMP model that you would like to simulate from.
#' @param PF: pfilter object, the result of calling
#'    pfilter(..., save.states = TRUE). Note that the states must be saved in
#'    this object for the function to work.
#' @param covarGen: function that is used to generate covariates, if the model
#'   needs covariates to run rprocess.
#' @param nsims: Integer number of simulations desired.
#' @param seed: seed for the random number generator.
#' @param cores: Integer number of cores to be used. If this number is
#'    greater than 1, the simulations will be done in parallel.
